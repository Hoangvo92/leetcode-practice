You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.


Code:
Python:
    def looprun(j, s, count):
    checker = j.split("")
    store = s.split("")
       for i in store:
           if i in checker:
              count = count + 1
     return count
              
        
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        #run loop
        c = 0 # count variable
        return looprun(J, S, c)
        
   Wrong result: code not compile because in python, there is no split(""). Instead, list(J) coverts the issue
   
   
   Correct result:
     def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        checker = list(J)
        store  = list(S)
        count = 0
        for i in store:
            if i in checker:
                count= count + 1
        return count

  >>> word = 'abc'
>>> L = list(word)
>>> L
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> ''.join(L)
'abc'

>>> word = 'a,b,c'
>>> L = word.split(',')
>>> L
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> ','.join(L)
'a,b,c'
